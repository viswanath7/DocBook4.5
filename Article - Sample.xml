        <title>What is DocBook ?</title>
        <para>DocBook is an SGML dialect developed by O'Reilly and HaL Computer
            Systems in 1991. It is currently maintained by the Organization for the
            Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). DocBook describes
            the content of articles, books, technical manuals, and other documents.
            Although DocBook is focused on technical writing styles, it is general
            enough to describe most prose writing. In this article, I'll discuss an
            XML variant of the DocBook DTD that is also available.

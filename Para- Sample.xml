    This paragraph contains an itemizedlist. An itemized list is one in which each entry is marked with a bullet or other dingbat
    
    <itemizedlist mark="opencircle">
        <title>The component suffered from three failings:</title>
        <listitem>
            <para>It was slow</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>It ran hot</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem override="bullet">
            <para>It didn't actually work</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    Of these three, the last was probably the most important.
